      <description>Picture of veggies that I cut. How the call with dad is longer than usual. Had a topic to talk about. Till now, i always thought i can buy food - like i should mom this much amount for her “services”. But, I am realizing that its an activity and pretty common one at it. I can have a lot of discussions around this topic with almost anyone. Learn from them.</description>
